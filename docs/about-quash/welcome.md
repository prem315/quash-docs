# Welcome

**Quash** is a software testing platform dedicatedly built for mobile applications. With Quash, you can effortlessly generate bug tickets directly from your mobile device, auto-capturing session recordings and developer logs. Saving both reporting and resolution time, Quash can make your testing 5x faster.

We have already saved 3000+ hours for teams across the globe. Quash is purpose-built for software development teams, highly considering their existing processes. To ensure the seamless continuity of these processes, we integrate with most of the popular issue-tracking tools (Jira, Linear, Slack, Sheets).

Our vision is to ensure that you never need to compromise with Pace to deliver Quality. We will keep helping you ship better products, faster.

## What is Quash?

With Quash, testers (QAs, PMs, Designers, Developers, CEOs, Sales Executives, or anyone else) can instantly create bug and crash reports. While testing an application on a mobile device, a tester can trigger Quash with a simple shake (it auto-triggers in case of a crash). It auto-captures screenshots, session recordings, steps to reproduce, device details, crash logs, and network calls. Plus, they can add descriptions or even voice notes.

Quash compiles all of this information into a comprehensive ticket on the dashboard for the developers. The tickets provide end-to-end context of the bug, eliminating the need to get on calls with the testers and hop on multiple other tools to find the right logs. These tickets can be tracked on the platform itself, or exported to another issue tracker like Jira.
