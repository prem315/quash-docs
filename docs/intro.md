## What is Quash?

With Quash, testers (QAs, PMs, Designers, Developers, CEOs, Sales Executives, or anyone else) can instantly create bug and crash reports. While testing an application on a mobile device, a tester can trigger Quash with a simple shake (it auto-triggers in case of a crash). Quash auto-captures screenshots, session recordings, steps to reproduce, device details, crash logs, and network calls. Testers can put in any other information as a description or a voice note.

Quash compiles all of this information into a comprehensive ticket on the dashboard for the developers. The tickets provide end-to-end context of the bug, eliminating the need to get on calls with the testers and hop on multiple other tools to find the right logs. These tickets can be tracked on the platform itself, or exported to another issue tracker like Jira.

## Our Vision

Our vision is to ensure that you don't need to compromise with Pace to deliver Quality.

We believe that software is the backbone of our new world, and that it can truly take it further ahead. To ensure that this progress happens at a good pace and has top-class quality, we're building Quash.

In today's dynamic and fast-paced digital landscape, user expectations evolve rapidly.
This requires swift feature development and improvements, within compact deadlines. While businesses aspire to meet these user expectations, they often find themselves hindered by outdated and inefficient processes. We are helping them overcome these problems by building solutions addressing process bottlenecks, eliminating manual tasks, and leveraging AI to assist testing and deployment.

We solve for everyone participating in the building of an application, we keep developers at the core of our solutions. All of our capabilities have been designed while keeping in mind the abilities, processes, and responsibilities of developers. -->
