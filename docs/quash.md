# What Exactly is Quash?

**Quash** is more than just a toolâ€”it's your bug and crash reporting ally. Whether you're a QA, PM, Designer, Developer, or even a CEO, you can generate reports on-the-fly. While on a mobile device, a simple shake activates Quash (or it auto-activates during a crash). It's intuitive, capturing screenshots, session recordings, reproduction steps, device specifics, crash logs, and network interactions. Plus, you can add descriptions or even voice notes.

All this rich data is collated into a comprehensive ticket, available on the developer's dashboard. This holistic view eliminates the hassle of lengthy calls and sifting through various tools for the right logs. You can either monitor these tickets on Quash or export them to platforms like Jira.
